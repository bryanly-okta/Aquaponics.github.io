    <p>Aquaponics is a form of agriculture that combines raising fish in tanks (recirculating aquaculture)
    with soilless plant culture (hydroponics).  In aquaponics, the nutrient-rich water from raising fish
    provides a natural fertilizer for the plants and the plants help to purify the water for the fish.
    Aquaponics can be used to sustainably raise fresh fish and vegetables for a family, to feed a village or
    to generate profit in a commercial farming venture, year â€˜round, in any climate.</p>
